Hangman is a word-guessing game where players must guess letters to complete a hidden word before the "hangman" is fully drawn. This implementation of the game is built with React and Redux.

Installation:
1.	Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.	In the project directory, run npm install to install the required dependencies.
3.	Run npm start to start the development server.
4.	Open http://localhost:3000 in your web browser to view the game.

Usage:
To play:
1.	The game will randomly select a word for you to guess.
2.	Click on letters to guess them. Incorrect guesses will reduce your remaining guesses.
3.	Keep guessing letters until you either complete the word or you run out of guesses.
4.	If you complete the word, you win! If you run out of guesses, you lose.
